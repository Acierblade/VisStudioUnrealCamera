# Visualization Studio Development Kit

In order to make the Visualization Studio more accessible to the faculty, students, and staff at NC State, this course has been created to explain how to use the Visualization Studio with the Unreal Engine. The course covers how to prepare an existing Unreal Engine 4 or Unreal Engine 5 project for use in the space. We hope you enjoy the course.
